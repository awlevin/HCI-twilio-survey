To run the program, fill in your credentials in the `start.sh` shell script, change permissions on the script file using `chmod <number> start.sh` if necessary. `<number>` should probably be `700` if you want the script to be private (i.e. only you can read, write, execute) or `755` if you want those same permissions but everyone else will only have read and execute permissions.

Then use ./start.sh to run the program!
